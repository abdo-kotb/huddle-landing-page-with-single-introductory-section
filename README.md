## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font Awesome Library
- CSS Normalize
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

There was an issue in mid-screens that some text was overflowing out of the body, and I had to use `overflow: hidden` in order to detect the source of the issue.
It was the first time for me to use it in the `body` tag and learning how to do that was a fun process.
To see how the process went, see below:
```css
html {
  overflow: auto;
}
body {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

The width of the chat app image was a problem for me and I had to check so many different absolute and relative units and other properties to make it look responsively as it is now, but I still feel it could look much better so I will keep learning more about that and try to improve the design more.
